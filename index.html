            I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly
            feel I got every penny's worth.

            " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people
            who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
            thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully
            switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

            " Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
            learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about
            the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
            assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no
            tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
            certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "
